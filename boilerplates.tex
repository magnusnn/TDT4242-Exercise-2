\subsubsection{Requirements}
\label{goal_2_requirements}

\paragraph{ACC active-state}

    \item When brake force higher than initiated is applied the ACC shall be deactivated
    \item When the ACC is active the driver shall be informed with the set speed information
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{ACC off-state}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item When the ACC system shuts down the driver shall be informed
    \item When the ACC system is not available the driver shall be informed
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{ACC stand-by}

    \item When the ACC is active the driver shall be able to deactivate the system with a touch on the clutch pedal
    \item When the ACC is in stand-by the system shall preform a self-test and shut down if not completed
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Testability}
The numers reflect the goals in section \ref{goal_2_requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item This can be tested either by a user driving or a simulated test. The goal is to test if the the vehicle speed is controlled either automatically by maintaining a time gap to a forward veichle, or to maintain the set speed. So this is a to-part test where you cant test both requirements at once. Does require to test two systems, time gap and maintaining the set speed. The vehicle shall maintain a set time gap to the forward vehicle. On the other test the vehicle shall accelerate or decelerate if the vehicle speed is either lower or higher than the set speed. Possible to retest and restart test.
    \item The system shall deactivate the ACC if active whenever the brake force applied by the user is higher than initiated. This test can be performed by a driver and to see if the ACC is deactivated when the brakes is used. One can also simulate this test saying that a given brake force is applied. What this brake force is set to have to be calibrated before the test. Possible to retest and restart test.
    \item By activating the ACC, a symbol or some other indication shall be displayed to the user. This can be tested simply by either running a test or an experiment. The requirement is clear and concise. Does not require other systems to be tested and should be done fairly simple. Possible to retest and restart test.
    \item When the ACC system shuts down the user shall be notified. This can be done by causing a self test to fail and shut down the system through an experiment. The requirement is clear and concise. Does require that other systems is tested and functional with a simulated error in the self test. One can observe if the ACC is deactivated and that a notification is forwarded to the driver. Possible to retest and restart test.
    \item By disabling the ACC a notification shall be displayed to the user. This requirement is somewhat wage and a definition of what informed means shall be specified. This test can be done by having the ACC deactivated an that an icon in the driver console to be activated if the ACC is unable. The test does not require other system to be tested and should be a fairly straight forward test to complete. Possible to retest and restart test.
    \item You can either execute a test or run an experiment. The requirement is clear and concise. Does require that the clutch system is working correctly. The force of the clutch pedal can either be simulated or with a physical test.One can observe whether the system is deactivated or not. It is possible to retest and restart test.
    \item By simulating a self test of the system one can observe if the system shuts down if the self test fails. This can either be done with a test or as an experiment. The requirement does not specify what type of error on the self test to be failing. Does require the self test of the vehicle to be tested and working, and this can be mimicked through a computer. One can observe if ACC is deactivated with an incomplete test. Possible to retest and restart test.
